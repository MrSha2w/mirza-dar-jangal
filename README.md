Teaching through games is one of the traditional methods that enthusiastically encourages children to learn. On the other hand, the beneficial use of computers for children and adolescents is essential. Therefore, in this game, we have focused on creating an engaging and enjoyable environment for teaching mathematics and chemistry lessons.

In this game, the emphasis of the mathematics lesson is on practicing and strengthening basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additionally, in chemistry, the focus is on learning and memorizing the names of chemical compounds. The main character of this game, Mirza, starts running in a forest and an endless road, where he must jump over obstacles and avoid colliding with them. Along the way, Mirza is asked questions related to each lesson, and by choosing the correct answers, he earns points. As the path becomes longer, the questions become more challenging, and there are more obstacles.

This game is developed using the open-source pygame library in Python. Relying on the principles of repetition and mental calculation techniques leads to increased concentration in children, improvement in the speed and accuracy of calculations, and enhancement of the learning process.
